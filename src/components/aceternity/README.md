# Aceternity UI Components

This directory is for UI components sourced from Aceternity UI (https://ui.aceternity.com/).

## Guidelines

1.  **One Component Per File**: Each component should be in its own file (e.g., `bento-grid.tsx`).
2.  **Keep Dependencies in Mind**: Aceternity UI components often rely on `framer-motion`. Ensure it is installed in `package.json`.
3.  **Styling**: Adapt component styles as needed to match the application's theme using Tailwind CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
